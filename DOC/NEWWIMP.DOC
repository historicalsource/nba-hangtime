NOTES ON THE NEW WIMP (Remember, this is only the BEGINNING!)


General Rule...
	Right Click OR ESCAPE  to exit a mode or cancel what
					you're doing
	Left Click OR ENTER to take action or select something

Also...
	In old WIMP, you usually clicked on an image or palette and
	then on the function you wanted to perform.  In new WIMP, you
	click on the function first, and then select as many images
	or palettes as you want until you ESCAPE from that mode.

Notable Exception...
	When you are in a color selection mode (Modify Colors, Color
		Cycle, Pixel Replace, etc.)  Left Click selects
		the first or source color, Right Click selects the
		destination or last color.

Key things...
	Cursor keys move the cursor just as the mouse would.
	Shift-Arrow keys moves the cursor in greater chunks

	ENTER is same as left click
	ESCAPE is same as right click

	Home, End, Delete, and Page Down move the DRAW COLOR box
		around the color block.  This works even if the color
		block is not displayed.

	Grey Plus increments the source color
		EXCEPT in Modify Color Range when it adjusts 
			R,G and B simultaneously
	Grey Minus decrements the source color
		EXCEPT in Modify Color Range when it adjusts 
			R,G and B simultaneously
	
On the target screen only...
	CTRL-Left Click  selects the pixel you are pointing at as the
			DRAW color
	CTRL-Right Click selects the pixel you are pointing at as the
			ERASE color

When you are changing animation points...
	SHIFT-RIGHT CLICK restores the animation point to where it was 
			originally.  NOTE: Once you leave the target
			screen, the animation point becomes fixed and can
			not be restored to an earlier state!

When loading images...
	SHIFT-Left Click allows you to drop multiple copies and even
		paint with the image.


SOME COOL NEW FEATURES...
	Stronger communication with GSP.
	Checking for disk space before writing to disk.
	Clean entering and exiting target screen without crashes.
		(See note below)
	New command lets you restart GSP art program from within WIMP.
	Mouse sensitivity range for being on target screen.
	Can have your background and cursor colors automatically set
		when you start WIMP.
	New function: ADD COLORS TO A PALETTE! (increases the number
		of colors in the palette so you can set up color animations
		or just put in some additional colors. This does not set
		the new colors, just increases the number of colors
		associated with the palette)
	Extract feature automates the creation of many images from one
		large one. (and sets animation points for you)
	Messages on console telling you what mode you're in.
	For the Img/Palette Directory, Sequence/Script Directory, and
		Draw Mode, you get new Menu Bars so more commands
		are at your reach easily. 
	While you make a box, the endpoints and size are constantly
		displayed and updated.
	Copy Work area commands work the way you think they should.
	In ZOOM mode, you can now pan by scrolling the box around instead
		of pressing directional buttons.	
	Bulletproof and transparent handling of "out of memory"
		conditions.
	Pixel Swap on images added to the pixel replace option.
	Can create any number of scripts (formerly buffers). Still can
		only see 4 at a time, though (for now).
	Read Multiple VDA Files at once using only one palette and
		create a script automatically.
	Range modify acts like a real tint. You can always go back to 
		the original state.
	Animations get reloaded automatically when something relevant 
		changes.  You should never need a "RELOAD FRAMES" command.
	File windows give you a better way to create and select files.
	Images, Palettes, Sequences and Scripts can all be "marked" for
		Range operations.
	Marking can be by name, position, or (for images) by palette.
	You can mark unused palettes.
	Search and replace on image, palette, script or sequence names.
	Delete a Sequence or Delete a Script without having to delete all
		the frames inside.
	Palette List shows which palettes are in the color map and which
		colors they occupy.
	When you change colors in the color map, WIMP now detects if those
		colors are part of a palette and gives you the option of
		changing the palette or not.
	Animation point values are displayed with the directory for each
		image. You can now click on them and type in values if
		you wish.
	You can change the animation points on a RANGE of images by
		either setting them to a specific value or offsetting 
		them by a constant value.		
	Sequence and script editing is easier.
	Condense now gives you the option of stopping after identical
		and unused colors are removed.
	True Tinting (and brightness control when R,G, and B are all
		adjusted together.
	Anim pts are now transferred with .VDA files between Wimp and Wtarg
	Merge Function merges any number of palettes into one.
	Can load images larger than screen size. (Wimp breaks them up into
		smaller images)
	Can load .VDA files containing 24-bit color maps.
	Can place as many images on screen as will fit with one click.
	Can place all parts of multi part images on screen at once.   
	Modify Colors now has an UNDO function which lets you to go
		back to the state you were in when you selected the
		current range or color.
	Shadow options allow you to create a new separate shadow image.

*****************************************************
*   IF YOUR SYSTEM SEEMS TO BE HUNG UP...           *
*****************************************************

	...wait a few seconds.  You should get a flashing message that
	says "GSP timed out on..."  Make a note of the seemingly cryptic
	numbers at the end of the message, then hit ESCAPE or Right click
	to remove it.  

	WIMP NOW TRIES TO RESEND A TIMED OUT COMMAND!

	If you get another of the same message, repeat the procedure.

	If you keep getting the same message, PRESS and HOLD BOTH
	MOUSE BUTTONS AT THE SAME TIME after you clear the flashing 
	message.  At this point...
	1) You may be alive again.  Try to do something. (don't be scared)
	2) You may time out again.
	3) you may get an "I'M CONFUSED" message when you try to go to
		the target screen.

	At any point, you should be able to save your work and exit
	WIMP.  If you find you are still alive, just keep going.
	Before you give up, there is a last resort that may get you
	going without a problem. It is the "RESTART GSP" Command in the
	first menu (at the left of the menu bar).  If that doesn't work,
	you may have to save your work and restart WIMP.  It is extremely
	unlikely that you will crash so severely that you lose work!



EDITING KEYS...

	When editing a field, the following keys may be used...

	HOME	gets you to beginning of field
	END	gets you to end of field
	DEL	deletes char at cursor without moving cursor
	BKSPC	deletes char before cursor and moves cursor left 1 space
	SHFT_LFTARR	moves cursor left on space
	SHFT_RTARR	moves cursor right on space
	INS	toggles between Overwrite (default) and
			 Insert (Cursor flashes) modes 
	TAB	clears field from current position to end
	ESC  	exits and restores original field
	ENTER	exits and accepts changes to field

IGNORE	When more than one field are present...
IGNORE
IGNORE	LFTARR	moves to next field
IGNORE	RTARR	moves to prev field
IGNORE	UPARR	moves to field above
IGNORE	DNARR   moves to field below
IGNORE	SHFT_UPARR,PGUP		increments field
IGNORE	SHFT_DNARR,PGDN		decrements field


STRING MATCHING...

For search strings...
	*	matches any number of any characters
	?	matches any one character
	@	matches any number (>0) of the previous character
	< or %	anchors the search string to the beginning of
			 the scanned strings
	> or $	anchors the search string to the end of
			 the scanned strings
	[...]	encloses a set.  A set is a set of characters
		to match or a range of chars to match.
		EXAMPLES:  [1a2b] will match a single occurance
			   of 1, a, 2, or b
			   [a-e] will match a single occurance of
			   a, b, c, d, or e
			   [*?] will match an asterisk or question mark
			   since they normally would be reinterpreted
 			   as wildcards.


For translation strings...
	^	will be replaced with the source string.

		i.e.  if the source string was [1-9] and the
		replacement string is :^:  then the following translations
		take place...
			FUCK1      becomes	FUCK:1:
			FUCK2	   becomes	FUCK:2:
			B7TMP	   becomes	B:7:TMP





ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES...

IMGDIR=directory where .img files are
VDADIR=  "        "    .vda files are
TMP=directory where you want temp. files to be created (RAM disk if you have one);
