	General Description
	-------------------

		The Z-UNIT DMA is used to do very rapid serial to block
	data conversions, from image RAM/ROM to the video bitmap.  The
	DMA has its own 32-bit wide bus for the transfer.  Once it is
	given the GO signal the GSP is no longer required.  However image
	RAM/ROM and the video bitmap are "locked-out" for the duration
	of the DMA operation.  The DMA is also equipped with the ability
	to flip and clip the block image, along with constant color
	substitution etc.

	DMA Registers
	-------------

		The DMA has ten 16-bit registers to control a serial
	to block transfer. Below they are listed with their physical
	address and mnemonic. Put these mnemonics in your SYSINC.ASM file.

	Control Register
	----------------

		The DMA performs any given operation based on the
	control register. Currently the control register uses 7 of its
	16 bits to define the operation, they are as follows:

		        CONTROL REGISTER
			-----------------
	 15	     5			         0
	 ____	     ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ ____
	|    | ...  |    |    |    |    |    |  --+--> Write Zero Data
	 -+--	     -+-- -+-- -+-- -+-- -+-- ----
	  |	      |    |    |    |    |----------> Write Non-Zero Data

	  |	      |
	  |	      |------------------------------> Flip about X-axis
	  |
	  |------------------------------------------> DMA GO bit

	Write Zero Data	- Bit 0
	-----------------------
		If Bit 0 of the control register is set then any source
	data that is zero will be written, otherwise it will not.

	Write Non-Zero Data - Bit 1
	---------------------------
		If Bit 1 is set then all non-zero source data will be
	written.

	Note: To write all source data, Bits 0 and 1 should be set
	      simultaneously.


	Write Constant on Zero Data - Bit 2
	-----------------------------------
		This will cause the constant byte, at DMACON, to be written
	in place of any zeros in the source data.

	Write Constant on Non-Zero Data	 - Bit 3
	----------------------------------------
		In this case the constant byte will be written in place
	of any Non-zero source data.


	Note: Setting Bits 2 & 0 or Bits 3 & 1, simultaneously, will
	      cause results for which the hardware department cannot
	      be held responsible.


	Flipping about Y (left to right) - Bit 4
	----------------------------------------
		Setting this bit will cause the DMA to flip the source
	data about the Y-axis, described below.

	Flipping about X (up and down) - Bit 5
	--------------------------------------
		Setting this bit will cause the DMA to flip the source
	data about the X-axis, also described below.

	DMA GO bit - Bit 15
	-------------------
		When this bit is set it will initiate the DMA operation.
	This bit is also used as a DMA Ready flag. Reading a 1 from this
	bit indicates that the DMA is busy, a 0 indicates DMA ready.



	Clipping and Flipping
	---------------------

		These operations use the offset register, a shortened
	Horizontal size and a modified source data starting address.
	There are a few equations to help calculate these parameters.

	They make use of the following mnemonics:

	HS	-	Horizontal Size, this is the Horizontal size of
			 the data displayed on the screen.

	LC	-	Left Clip, this is the number of pixels that are
			 to be clipped off of the left side of the block

	OF	-	Offset, this is the value that is stored at DMAOFS.

	RC	-	Right Clip, this is the number of pixels that are
			 to be clipped off of the right side of the block.

	SA	-	Starting address, this is the starting memory address
			 of the source data.

	TS	-	Total Size, this is the total horizontal size of the
			 source data. This includes the padded zeros at the
			 end of each row, so TS mod 4 is always 0.



	Offset Register
	---------------
		The offset is not difficult to comprehend but it can
	cause a little confusion, so it shall be discussed here.
	The Horizontal Size register tells the DMA how many pixels(bytes)
	make up a row. Once the DMA has reached the end of the row it
	adds the offset to the current source data address to gain access
	to the beginning of the next row. So if an image is actually 20
	pixels wide and you wish only to display the first 15 per row,
	then a 15 is stored in the Horizontal Size register(DMAHSZ) and
	5 is stored in the offset reg.

		Now for the confusing part. Every image is stored so that
	the number of pixels per row is evenly divisible by 4. However
	the visible horizontal size of an image doesn't necessarily abide
	by this rule. To compensate, images are "padded" with zeros at the
	end of a row to make them conform. This is the Total Size(TS).
	The total size is always the number of bytes per row including the
	padded zeros. If DMAOFS is zero, and DMAHSZ is the number of bytes
	of actual image data in the row, then the DMA will figure its way
	to the next row of source data, regardless of padded zeros
	(see below).  


	image_data
		.byte	>05,>05,>07,>FF,>07,>07,0,0
  			 |____________________|	|_|
				   |		 |______ zeros for padding.
		  		   |
			  	   |____________________ actual image data.

		Above shows one row of image data, HS = 6 and TS = 8.
	If this were to be displayed normally(no clipping), a 0 would
	go in DMAOFS and a 6 in DMAHSZ.  But, if you were to clip the last
	pixel of image data, you would set up like this: DMAHSZ = 5,
	DMAOFS = 3.

	The general idea is then:

			     if	not clipping --> OF = 0
			     if	clipping     --> OF = TS - HS


	Right Clipping (decreased HS)
	----------------------------

		HS = HS - RC
		OF = TS - HS
			
	Left Clipping (decreased HS, increased SA)
	-------------------------------------------

		HS = HS - LC
		OF = TS - HS
		SA = SA + (LC*8)

	Right and Left Clipping
	-----------------------

		HS = HS - (RC + LC)
		OF = TS - HS
		SA = SA + (LC*8)

	Flipping about Y	
	----------------

		(DMACTL)Bit 4 = 1
		(DMACTL)Bit 5 = 0

		HS = HS - (RC + LC)
		OF = HS + TS - 1
		SA = SA + ((HS+LC) * 8)


	Flipping about X
	----------------

		(DMACTL)Bit 4 = 0
		(DMACTL)Bit 5 = 1

		HS = HS - (RC + LC)
		OF = -(HS + TS - 1)
		SA = SA + LC*8 + ((TS*8)(VS-1))


	Flipping about X & Y
	--------------------

		(DMACTL)Bit 4 = 1
		(DMACTL)Bit 5 = 1

		HS = HS - (RC + LC)
		OF = (HS - TS) - 1
		SA = SA + ((TS*8)(VS-1) + (HS+LC)*8)
