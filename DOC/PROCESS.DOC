	Description
	-----------

		The Z-Unit software system is designed to allow the
	programmer maximum flexibility in game program design while
	adhering to the stringent time requirements of real time
	execution.  The game program consists of many small routines which
	may or may not be active at any one time.  These routines are
	called processes.
 
		Two singly linked lists are maintained by the process
	system.  A FREE list which ties together all processes available
	for allocation.  And an ACTIVE list which holds all of the 
	currently active processes.  The ACTIVE list is traversed once
	every 16 msec under normal conditions by the main loop.  During
	this traversal each process is checked to see if it is ready
	to activate or wakeup.  If it is, then it is called upon to 
	execute until it gives control back to the main loop by sleeping
	or dying.  Once the list has been traversed, the main loop
	waits the remainder of the 16 msec then starts over.

		The process data structure is defined as follows:

			mnem.	description				size
			-----	-----------				----

			PLINK	- link to the next process in the list. (32)
			PROCID 	- process I.D.				(16)
			PTIME   - time until next dispatch.		(16)
			PSPTR	- process local stack pointer.		(32)
			PDATA	- process local data storage.		(18x32)
			PSDATA	- process local stack area.		(24x32)

			


	Creating a process
	------------------

		Before a process can be dispatched, it must first be
	created.  All of the routines for creation and destruction of
	processes are contained in a file called xPROC.ASM where x is
	usually the name of the game or non-existant.  Usually a process
	is created by another process, in this case it will be the
	next process to be dispatched.

		GETPRC is the routine which creates the process, it
	takes the process I.D. in A1 and the process address in
	A7.  It is used like this:

	       		MOVI	NEW_PROCESS_ID,A1
	       		MOVI	NEW_PROCESS_ADDR,A7
	       		CALLA	GETPRC

		The macro call for this is:

			CREATE	 NEW_PROCESS_ID,NEW_PROCESS_ADDR

		If process creation was successful then GETPRC
	returns, in A0, the pointer to the new process and the Z bit
	clear.  If there are no more processes available then the
	Z bit is set and no process is created.




	Sleeping and Dying
	------------------

		A process must voluntarily give up control of the
	processor so that other process are allowed to execute.  The
	process may give up control in one of two ways, by sleeping, or
	by dying.  Going to sleep means that the process will pause for
	a specified amount of time and begin executing where it left off.
	Dying means that the process is finished and wishes to be taken
	off of the ACTIVE list.

		Go to sleep as follows:

			MOVI	SLEEP_TIME,A0	;# of 16 msec "ticks" to sleep
			CALLA	PRCSLP		;sleep
			.			;continue executing
			.
			.

		The macro calls for this are:

			SLEEP	SLEEP_TIME	;sleep constant
			SLEEPR	Ax		;sleep register
			SLEEPM	@MEM_LOC,FIELD	;sleep memory

		When a process goes to sleep its wakeup address and
	registers A8 - A11 are pushed onto the process stack and the
	process stack pointer (A12) is stored at PSPTR.  All other
	registers are not guaranteed during any sleep.

		Upon wakeup, the process stack pointer is restored to
	A12 and registers A8 - A11 are pulled off of the process stack
	along with the wakeup address.  Control is then transferred to 
	the process.
		
		Die as follows:	

			JAUC	SUCIDE		;Jump never to return

		The macro call for this is:

			DIE



	Calling a subroutine which sleeps
	---------------------------------

		First of all, a subroutine that sleeps may be called
	only by an active process.  If the process wishes to call one
	of these subroutines it must first push the return address
	onto the process stack then jump to the routine.  JSRP is the
	macro which will handle this action.  A subroutine which is
	called with JSRP must use the macro RETP to return, or pull
	the return address from the process stack and jump there.

		Example:

			PROCESS_1:
				MOVK	1,A0
				SLL	16,A0
				MOVY	A1,A0		
				JSRP	SLEEP_SUB
				DIE

			SLEEP_SUB:
				ADD	A1,A0
				SLEEP	1
				RETP


	Note: Only calls to subroutines that sleep, require JSRP and
	      RETP. All other calls may be made normally.	



	The Process I.D. (PROCID)
	-------------------------

		The Process I.D. is a 16 bit value used to distinguish
	processes from one another.  For the most part these values
	are left at the discretion of the programmer.  However, there
	are some conventions which the system software follows.


		PROCID format:

     			   Bit 15                 Bit 0
				NEWI IIII IIII IIII

		N = NON-DESTRUCTIBLE process! No routine shall kill
		    a process with this bit set.

		E = Wave end wait process.  Any wave end routines shall
		    wait until the system is clear of these processes.

		W = Process not to be killed by wave end routines. 

		I = These bits are free, to be defined by the game.




	Accessing process variables
	---------------------------

		As mentioned above, each process has a block of RAM
	which is used to hold information pertinent to the process.
	This known as the process block.  While any given process is
	executing, A13 will hold the pointer to its process block.
	A13 shall remain as the pointer when calling any routines,
	unless otherwise stated by that routine.

		Through this pointer, the process may access any of
	its internal variables by using the mnemonic offsets previously
	described.

		Examples:

		     1.	The process wishes to load its current I.D.
			into register A0.

				MOVE	*A13(PROCID),A0,W

		     2. The process wishes to access the fourth long	
			word in its data area to register A4.

				MOVE	*A13(PDATA+60H),A4,L

		Since the process stack pointer is kept in A12 while
	the process is executing.  The process may push registers
	on to its local stack by the following:

				MMTM	A12,<register list>

		And remove them by:
		
				MMFM	A12,<register list>

	Note: It is of utmost importance that the process keep registers
	      A13 and A12 intact while calling any routines.  It is	
	      therefore recommended that the programmer refrain from	
	      using these registers unless it is absolutely necessary.
