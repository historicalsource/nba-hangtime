	Description
	-----------

		The ToddView debbuger is a source level debugger, that
	actually lets you debug a TMS34010 assembly language program
	using your own source code.  It is aimed at aiding in the
	development of video games and has many functions that follow
	the programming design here at Williams.

MOUSE COMMANDS  in memory display mode
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Click and hold both buttons down to EXIT.
Click Left button on any word to modify it.
Click Right button on any word to indirect through it.
   The word pointed at is the most significant of the address.
Click on any memory TYPE to set that type.
Visible buttons have same actions as listed above.

MAKING PATCHES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'P' will start a patch at the cursor bar.
Clicking both mouse buttons together on any line will start a patch at
   that line.
<ESC> - will ABORT the patch.
A patch can be any of the following:
   A GSP assembly instruction.
      Operands can be decimal #s, hex #s with leading '>' or trailing 'H',
      any global symbol or a local label.
   A LABEL local to the current file.
      The label must have a trailing ':' to be recognized.
   .byte #, .word #, .long #
   "INSERT", "APPEND"
      Enter INSERT or APPEND mode.  Instead of the patch overwriting the
      code at the same address, it is placed in the address space defined
      by the symbols TVPATCH, TVPATCHX.  This code is transparently made
      to execute as if it were inserted or appended to the line that
      was originally being patched.  TRAP 28 is used to transfer control
      to the patch.  TRAP 27 is used to transfer control from the patch.
      PATCHING a TRAP 27 or TRAP 28 once placed may cause unpredictable
      results, although the line before or after the TRAP may be patched.
      INSERT/APPEND is terminated by entering "Q" for the next instruction.
	
  (if a patch line is not understood, it won't be entered and it remains on
	the edit line to be modified.)

INSERT and APPEND patches require an entry in a statically allocated table,
there is currently only 100 entries in this table all though this may be
increased in the future if it seems insufficient.

START UP FILE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Each time TV is invoked on a file "blah", it checks for a file named
"blah.tvs" in the current directory and if it is not found it checks
again for "blah.tvs" in the directory specified by the environmental
variable "MWPATH".

The start up file can contain the following commands:

.tab N
	Set Tab expansion of text to N columns per tab.

.struct	filename
	Open file "filename" and scan for structure definitions of the
	following format:
		*struct structname     (this must start in column 1)
		fieldname1  .set  <offset>  ;[<TYPE>]
		fieldname2  .set  <offset>  ;[<TYPE>]
		  .
		  .
		*endstruct
	<offset>: <term>[<operand><term>]...
	   a <term> is either a hex or decimal 16 bit or less value, or
		it can be the name of a previously defined offset.
		If it is an offset name, it can be in the same structure
		or a different one, but it must have already been defined.
	   an <operand> is either '+' or '-'.
	   Don't put white space in between terms and operands.
	<TYPE>
	Memory types are three charachters,
	  char1 = U|S -> Unsigned|Signed
	  char2 = H|D -> Hex|Decimal
	  char3 = L|W|B -> Long|Word|Byte
	Structures can be displayed from the display memory command.
	The fields can also be referenced when making patches.
	If a field type is unspecified it will not be displayed in the
	structure display.  The field will still be known to the assembler.


.bp <GLOBAL SYM | ADDRESS>
	Sets a breakpoint at address or symbol.

.wp <GLOBAL SYM | ADDRESS>,[L|W|B],[H|D|A]
	Sets up a watch point to always display the value of the symbol.
	[L|W|B] optionally specifies symbol to be
		L -> long word (32 bits)
		W -> word
		B -> byte
	[H|D|A] optionally specifies symbol be displayed as a
		H -> Hex Value 
		D -> Decimal Value
		A -> Address of a Symbol

.km <KEY KEY-SEQUENCE>
	Defines a keymap of KEY to KEY-SEQUENCE.
	KEY is any single keystroke which is to be interpreted as
	   the sequence of keys in KEY-SEQUENCE.
	**NOTE** Bindings to AlphaNumeric Keys are not expanded when
	   in editing a string mode.
	The keys of KEY-SEQUENCE are not reinterpreted through any keymaps.
	The following characters are meta-chars:
		'^' -> control,   i.e. '^C' = control C
		'@' -> alternate, i.e. '@C' = alt C
		'!' -> function,  i.e. '!F1' = shifted function key 1
				  i.e. '!f1' = unshifted function key 1
		'\' -> literal, key following this key is accepted literally
				  i.e. '\^' = '^'
				  i.e. '\\' = '\'
		'"' -> named-key, i.e. "PGUP" = key with code of 0x8000|73
			following keys are known by name:
			"CR"	= Carriage Return,
			"BS"	= BackSpace,
			"ESC"	= Escape
			"PU"	= Page Up,
			"PD"	= Page Down
			"^PU"	= Control Page Up
			"^PD"	= Control Page Down
			"HOME"	= Home
			"END"	= End
			"^HOME"	= Control Home
			"^END"	= Control End
			"DEL"	= Delete
			"INS"	= Insert
			"R->"	= Right Arrow
			"L->"	= Left Arrow
			"D->"	= Down Arrow
			"U->"	= Up Arrow
			"^R->"	= Control Right Arrow
			"^L->"	= Control Left Arrow
	*** SAMPLE KEYBINDING TO DISPLAY STRUCT OBJ WITH f1 Key ***
	.km !f1 @D*OBJLIST\ OBJ\ OLINK"CR"


';', '*', '/'  Appearing as the first character of a line,
	marks the line as a comment to be ignored.
  
NOTES 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   If system appears hung, try CTL-Q which will cause any attempts
to communicate with a crashed GSP to be aborted.  This can cause
the state of the system to get screwed up if communications weren't
hung.

   To use debugger with incrementally linked files, the file type
of partially linked relocatable objects must be ".rlo" so that
the debugger knows to open up the corresponding ".map" file to get
information on files, sections and symbols for the members of those
objects.

TV loads a GSP resident piece of code "GDBG.OUT" that requires
address space from >FFFF0000 through >FFFFFC00

TV uses the following INTERRUPT VECTORS and redefines them if
the users program loads with them initialized.
   TRAP 8  - NMI used to stop/start the GSP
   TRAP 30 - Illegal Opcode
   TRAP 29 - BreakPoint
   TRAP 28 - Go to Patch Code
   TRAP 27 - Exit Patch Code

TV gets control from the GSP using traps and interrupts.   These push
the status word and program counter on the stack.  If the stack pointer
(SP) points at unreadable or unwriteable memory the debugger will lose
these values and can even lose control of the GSP entirely...

When TV gets control from the GSP, it first disables interrupts
then if the users program has a global label TVBP defined, it
will call that routine.  Before TV returns control to the users
program, if a global label TVBPX is defined TV will call that
routine also.

The program "crnchlst.exe" can be run on listing files to crunch
them into a more compact format.  This will roughly halve the
size of your listing files, and double the speed of TV when it is
operating on those files.  To crunch all files in a directory, enter
"crnchlst *.lst".  Files already crunched will be ignored.

These are statically allocated structures in TV.EXE, here
are their sizes and purposes.
MAX_FILES	80		maximum # of listing files. 	
MAX_VIEWS	50		max # opened view files (ALT-V).
MAX_GLOBALS	2500		maximum # of global symbols.
GBLS_CHARS	16000		maximum # characters of global symbol names.
MAX_LOCALS	500		max # of local symbols per file.
LOCALS_CHARS	6000		max # chars of local symbol names per file.
MAX_LINES	2048		MAX_LINES*SKIP_LINES is roughly the maximum
SKIP_LINES	25		   number of lines of opened listings.
PATCHTBLLEN	100		max # of (insert/append) patches per session.
MAX_STRUCTMEM	500		max # of members per structure definition
MAXSTRUCTNAME	4096		max # chars of member names per struct def.
MAX_STRUCTS	50		max # of structure definitions.
MAX_KEYMAPS	100		max # of keymap definitions
MAX_KEYCHARS	1000		max # of characters in keymap key sequences.
